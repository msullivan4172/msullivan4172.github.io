<p style="font-family:fragment core;font-size:30px;">Spent today back tracking and redoing a lot of the code I did yesterday.
Turns out I accidently didn't save where I left off  and had to rememeber the code I built. That's ok, more practice.
Today I want to try and "upload" this to github pages so that I can track my progress and see how my coding skills progress over time.</p>

<p style="font-family:fragment core;font-size:30px;">Github had me frustrated. I needed to walk away today and do some more research on how github works.
I watched a few youtube videos and now feel a little more confident in what I'm doing. I now understand that github will help me with saving my code(s) and building 
upon them rather than just publishing a website.</p>

<p style="font-family:fragment core;font-size:30px;">Github took up a lot of my time today but I did manage to add a page break, or horizontal line, and 
actually cleaned up the code a little better than what I had yesterday. 
I'll take the accomplishments no matter how little. </p>

<p style="font-family:fragment core;font-size:30px;"> Spent some time relearning the basics on the Sololearn app. Figured out backgound colors, inserting a picture, headers, font styles, and font sizes. 
I am stuck on one font not working but I'm going to wait and come back to it. There is still so much that I have forgotten and can't wait to dive into more. 
Figuring out coding is much like a puzzle which is making this a very fun learning experience for me. 
I can't wait to learn more.</p>
